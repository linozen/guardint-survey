This is the _merged_ data containing the responses to the questions from
both the Civil Society Scrutiny questionnaire and the Media Scrutiny
questionnaire. Since only some questions were asked in both questionnaires, this
_merged_ data represents a subset of all the questions that were asked in both
surveys individually.
